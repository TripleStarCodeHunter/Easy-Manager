This project is a franchise management system which includes different dashboards for admin as well as the franchise. A Franchise will be able to view data analytics and
register clients under their name. The admin will have privileges to register new franchises in addition to everything that a franchise will be able to do. The admin can monitor the revenue and client enrollment of every franchise. This ensures transparency and streamlines the client enrollment procedure.

Notable features include:
- Login and authorization via JWT Authentication
- Secured, protected routes based on user roles
- REST api with Get, Post, Update, Delete, Search, List endpoints
- Admin and Franchise dashboard with data analytics and graph
- CRUD functionality for both client and franchise models
- Search and filter functionality to find specific client or franchise
- Detailed client / franchise lists
- Franchise Payment Gateway integration using Stripe
- Custom error handlers and popups for better user experience
- Dynamic UI created using Ant Design component library
